# PAX
Minecraft AntiCheat based of PaperSpigot 1.8.8 

I've done this for learning purposes and I'm sure I
probably didn't do things as they should be done

This was meant to be a paid anticheat but I'm developing
other stuff at the moment, so I thought of making it open-source

I'm not sure if I'll continue this project, so feel free to use it as you wish

Huge shout-out to [packetevents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) as I think this is the best packet handler

## Checks 

- #### AutoClicker

This check just checks for brute cps values and if it is higher than 15, it alerts

- #### FastPlace

Same thing as the autoclicker check but it checks for block placing packets

- #### Timer

This timer check can detect 1% timer even with the player lagging and I'm pretty proud of it
